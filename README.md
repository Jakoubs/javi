A fully playable, legal-moves-only chess game for the terminal, built in pure Scala 3 with MVC architecture inspired by lichess.

└── Main.scala
```

### Model
Pure, immutable data and logic. Zero I/O. Fully unit-testable.

- `Board` – Map-based 8×8 board
- `GameState` – Complete snapshot (board + active colour + castling rights + en passant + clocks + history)
- `MoveGenerator` – Generates legal moves for all piece types including castling, en passant, promotion
- `GameRules` – Applies moves, updates state, detects check/checkmate/stalemate/draws

### View
Stateless renderer receiving a `GameState` and rendering state to a `String`.  
ANSI colours mimic lichess's board palette. Unicode chess symbols ♔♕♖♗♘♙.

### Controller
`CommandParser` parses raw strings into a `Command` ADT.  
`GameController` maintains `AppState` and dispatches commands functionally (pure `handleCommand` function).

## Features

- ✅ All legal moves enforced (pins, checks, discovered checks)
- ✅ Castling (king-side & queen-side, with transit-square attack detection)
- ✅ En passant
- ✅ Pawn promotion (q/r/b/n)
- ✅ Checkmate & stalemate detection
- ✅ 50-move rule
- ✅ Threefold repetition
- ✅ Insufficient material draw
- ✅ Undo
- ✅ Resign & draw by agreement
- ✅ Highlight legal moves with `moves e2`
- ✅ Last-move highlighting
- ✅ Board flip
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite

## Requirements

- **Java 11+**
- **sbt 1.9+** (`brew install sbt` / `sdk install sbt`)

---

## Run

```bash
cd chess
sbt run
```

## Test

```bash
sbt test
```

### Generate Coverage Locally

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
sbt clean coverage test

# Generate HTML report
sbt coverageReport

# View the report
open target/scala-3.3.1/scoverage-report/index.html
```

### Coverage Goals

- **Statement Coverage**: 80% minimum target
- **Branch Coverage**: 70% minimum target
- **Excluded**: UI components (`.view.*`), web components (`.web.*`), main classes

### Automated Coverage

Coverage is automatically generated and reported on:

- **Push** to `main` and `functional-improvements` branches
- **Pull Requests** to `main` and `functional-improvements` branches

### Coverage Reports

- **Local**: `target/scala-3.3.1/scoverage-report/index.html`
- **Coveralls**: https://coveralls.io/r/YOUR_USERNAME/chess?branch=main
- **Codecov**: https://codecov.io/gh/YOUR_USERNAME/chess
- **GitHub Actions**: Available as workflow artifacts

### Coverage Configuration

```scala
// build.sbt
coverageExcludedPackages := ".*\\.view\\..*;.*\\.web\\..*;.*\\.Main.*"
coverageMinimumStmtTotal := 80
coverageMinimumBranchTotal := 70
coverageFailOnMinimum := false
coverageHighlighting := true
```

## Design Principles

- **Functional**: `GameState`, `Board`, `Move` are all immutable case classes. State transitions return new values.
- **Testable**: Model and Controller logic are pure functions with no side effects. Tests cover all piece types, special moves, and edge cases.
- **MVC separation**: View only renders; Controller only dispatches; Model only contains rules.
